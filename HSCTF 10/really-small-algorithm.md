For this challenge, you were given n, e, and c to a RSA encrpytion. All I did to solve this was input the numbers into a RSA solver like this one: https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher and then got the flag out.

flag: flag{bigger_is_better}

Note: you can also use tools like RsaCtfTool or others and they will also get you the right answer.
