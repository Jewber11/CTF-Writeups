For this challenge, you were given a java file that you had to reverse engineer to get the flag. This was the easiest rev challenge and only tasked you with rebuilding the flag given the character at each index.

with this, we could just rebuild the flag character by character because we have every character in the flag given and the indicies that they are at. 

flag: flag{c0d1ng_i5_h4rd}
