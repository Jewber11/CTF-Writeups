This was the easiest web challenge and was pretty simple. You were given a link to a webpage. All you had to do was go into inspect elemment and the flag was just there in the html. Be careful not to click the hyperlinked text on the main page though because you get rick-rolled(I should have listened to the discription when it said to be careful).
