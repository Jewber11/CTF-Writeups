This challenge was just a simple RSA challenge where you have to decode the ciphertext given N, e, and c. To solve this I just used this website: https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher but you could also use tools like RsaCtfTool: https://github.com/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool

choosing either of those methods, you just put in your values and you get the flag:
tjctf{thr33s_4r3_s0_fun_fb23d5ed}
